# Borzo: Airfoil Design Acceleration Tool üöÄ  
üèÜ **3rd Place @ Gener8tor CS NEST Showcase**

## üìå Overview
Borzo is a web-based platform designed to accelerate the **airfoil and wing design process** for aerospace engineering applications. By leveraging real-time CAD generation, Borzo enables fast iteration and data-driven design.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: This README highlights core functionality. Some advanced backend logic, validation routines, and edge-case handling are excluded for brevity. Please refer to the code snippets and demo links for conceptual understanding.*
